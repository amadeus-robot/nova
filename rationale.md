Semantic Development Environment

A system that represents the entire software lifecycle as a Living System Graph. Development proceeds through an AI-powered, Test-Driven Refinement Pipeline, where high-level requirements are progressively lowered into verified, production-ready code.

Key Pillars:

The graph is layered, where each layer represents a version with a parent. 

The System Graph as SOT: Logic artifacts are nodes in a queryable, semantic graph.

Test-Driven Refinement: Requirements are born with Acceptance Criteria, which are translated into tests before implementation, ensuring correctness by design.

Context-Aware Generation: A smart Context Assembler uses vector embeddings to provide the LLM with all necessary information for any given task, dramatically improving accuracy.

Branching is implicit in the layered tree  graph.

Semantic Versioning: All changes are transactional, at data type or function level, enabling a new level of analysis and automated refactoring.

Level 0: The Conceptual Layer: This is the space for human-centric artifacts: user stories, design documents, mockups, architectural diagrams.

Level 1: Requirement & Acceptance Criteria
- the system elaborates for clarification of non-functional requirements and system constrains
- functional requiriments are formalized
- Change: A requirement should not just be a description. It must include machine-readable Acceptance Criteria. The Gherkin format (Given-When-Then) is perfect for this.
- 
- Example:
- 
- Requirement: "Users can request a password reset."
- 
- Acceptance Criterion 1: Given a user exists with the email "test@example.com", When they request a password reset, Then a unique reset token should be generated and stored for that user.

Acceptance Criterion 2: Given a non-existent user with the email "ghost@example.com", When they request a password reset, Then the system should return an error indicating the user was not found.

Level 2: High-Level Design & Test Scaffolding

The LLM does what you said: breaks the requirement into DataTypes and Function signatures.

Addition: The LLM also translates the Acceptance Criteria from Level 0 into scaffolding for integration tests. It doesn't write the test logic yet, just the test descriptions and function calls.

Level 3: Test Case Generation

Concept: Before writing any implementation logic, for each function signature from L1, the LLM generates a suite of unit test cases.

Input: Function signature (e.g., calculate_tax(amount, state)), its English description, and its associated DataTypes.

Output: A list of test cases as data records: (input: {amount: 100, state: "CA"}, expected_output: 8.25), (input: {amount: -10, state: "NY"}, expected_exception: "InvalidAmountError"), etc.

Why it's crucial: This forces the system to define "correctness" before implementation.

Level 4: Pseudocode & Logical Validation

When the LLM generates pseudocode, it now has a rich context: the function's purpose, its signature, and the explicit test cases it needs to pass.

Level 5: Implementation & Automated Verification

The LLM translates the pseudocode into actual code elixir/javascript/rust/etc.

Crucial Addition: The system then also generates the full, runnable test code from the scaffolds (L1) and test cases (L1.5).

The system automatically runs the generated tests against the generated code in a sandbox. The implementation is only accepted and linked into the graph if all tests pass. If they fail, the pipeline can be automatically re-run with the failure information as additional context, or it can be flagged for human review.

III. New Concepts to Consider
1. The "Context Assembler" & Vector Embeddings

The Problem: An LLM has a limited context window. To generate a function, it needs to know about the data types it uses and other functions it might call. How do you provide this?

The Solution: Every artifact in your System Graph (Requirement, DataType, Function signature, etc.) should have a vector embedding stored alongside it.

The "Context Assembler" is a service that, before calling the LLM to perform a lowering task, does the following:

Gets the primary subject (e.g., the Pseudocode for function X).

Performs a vector search to find the most semantically relevant artifacts (e.g., the definitions of DataTypes used in the signature, and other functions in the same namespace that perform similar actions).

Assembles these pieces into a perfectly formatted prompt for the LLM.
This solves the context problem and makes the LLM's job much easier and more accurate.

The system doesn't assume the use of human programmers.

Feedback loop: 
   Test Failure -> New Context -> Re-run Pipeline. 
   After N failed attempts, we go redo the plan, noting the problem to generate this particular node
   After N fails of the plan, the feature gets flagged as on hold, to be reviewed again by a human or the long term planning system
   this intentionally yields a form of RL over the system

On debug: the system allows reasoning in the codebase context, using tool calls to execute proving functions, trying to replicate errors, given the complexity of most systems, debug will be done either by a debug agent, or by a human reverse engineer.

human in the loop role, be one of: 
 - System Architect 
  - researcher
  - product developer (new role)

green vs brown field:
  - we aim to recreate main libraries from scratch by the form of automated code translation, when needed
  - fallback: Graph Encapsulation: for components that must not be re-written, will use them like FFI is used now on modern software

key insights: 
  LLMs are nearing 700 words per second, no human will be able to meaningfully evaluate/debug changes without becoming a huge bottleneck
  SotA coding LLMs handle a context window of 1m tokens

Performance of the Graph: most the time the system works with the graph that is visible from the tip of the layers, if we consider functions and datatypes for a whole complex codebase, say for example the linux kernel, any relatively mature graph database should still remain performant.

This system is a platform which will be opensource, so you don't build your product on a complex proprietary software. Third party tooling development is encouraged.

Exploratory Work: 
  we expect the system to aid on quick prototyping, by gradually rendering the software as requests get added, while helping greatly with iteration and refactoring in ways current automated tools can not at the moment

### On Semantic Integration (Replacing 'Merging')

The concept of "merging" in traditional version control is a text-level operation designed to reconcile changes in static files. In a Living System Graph, this concept is obsolete. We replace it with **Semantic Integration**, a process that operates on the level of intent and architectural coherence. The system's primary goal is to maintain the logical consistency of the entire system graph.

The value of any exploratory work (a "branch") is not in its final, generated code—which is a disposable artifact—but in the **knowledge captured** during its creation: the chain of requirements, design decisions, and test results.

Semantic Integration handles two primary scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Orthogonal Changes (Automated Semantic Rebase)

This is the common case where two branches modify different, non-overlapping parts of the system graph.

*   **Example:** One branch adds a new reporting feature, while another refactors the authentication module.
*   **Process:** The system identifies that the changes are semantically independent. It will automatically integrate them by serially applying one set of changes on top of the other's base layer (a "semantic rebase"). It then re-runs all relevant tests for both sets of changes to verify that the integrated whole is still correct. This is a fully automated, fast-forward-style integration.

#### Scenario 2: Divergent Solutions (Architectural Synthesis)

This is the critical case where two branches offer different solutions to the **same high-level requirement**. This is not treated as a "conflict" to be resolved automatically, but as a **design choice to be made explicitly**.

*   **Example:** To satisfy the requirement "Users should receive real-time updates," one branch implements a solution using **WebSockets**, while another uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
*   **System Behavior:**
    1.  **Detects Design Divergence:** The system recognizes that both branches fulfill the same parent requirement but introduce fundamentally different, and potentially incompatible, architectural components and logical flows. A simple rebase is impossible and undesirable.
    2.  **Elevates for Human Review:** The system **halts automated integration**. It flags the situation for the human architect. Merging two distinct architectures automatically is a non-goal.
    3.  **Presents an "Architectural Choice" Summary:** The system doesn't just show a `diff`. It presents a high-level summary of the "learned lessons" from each branch, allowing the architect to make an informed decision. This summary includes:
        *   **Branch A (WebSockets):** Key design nodes (e.g., `WebSocketManager` component), test results (e.g., "Passed all functional tests, but performance tests show 15% higher server memory usage"), and implications (e.g., "Enables bi-directional communication").
        *   **Branch B (SSE):** Key design nodes (e.g., `SSEConnectionHandler`), test results (e.g., "Passed all tests, simpler implementation"), and implications (e.g., "Lower server overhead, but communication is unidirectional").
    4.  **The Architect Directs the Synthesis:** The architect, now armed with comparative data, makes a strategic decision. This is not a code-level merge but a new instruction for the graph:
        *   **Option A: Promote One Path.** The architect decides, "The SSE approach is better for our current needs." The WebSocket branch is then archived (preserving its knowledge for future reference), and the SSE branch is integrated as the new canonical path.
        *   **Option B: Synthesize a New Path.** The architect might say, "I want the simplicity of the SSE implementation, but we need to add a new requirement to plan for future bi-directional needs." The architect then creates a *new* design node in the graph that combines learnings from both. The system then discards both previous branches and generates a new, superior implementation based on this synthesized design.
    5.  **Captures the "Why":** The architect's decision and rationale are captured as a permanent node in the graph. This creates an auditable architectural history, explaining *why* a particular path was chosen over another.

By treating a "merge conflict" as a signal of **design dissonance**, the system forces critical architectural decisions to be made consciously and transparently, leveraging the exploratory work from all paths without attempting to crudely smash them together at the code level. The focus shifts from reconciling text to synthesizing knowledge.

Your model of versioned,  is far more scalable. Let's elaborate on this from different perspectives, incorporating your clarification.

### Performance at Scale: The Power of Immutable Graph Layers


**The Challenge:** A system representing the entire Linux kernel—with millions of functions, data types, and decades of history—seems like it would create a graph so massive that querying it would be prohibitively slow, especially during the critical code generation pipeline.

**The Solution: Operations on the "Tip" vs. Historical Analysis**

This concern is addressed by a core architectural principle: **The system does not operate on a single, monolithic graph containing all historical versions.** Instead, it operates on immutable, versioned layers. Think of it like Git: your day-to-day work happens on the `HEAD` of a branch, which is a single, clean snapshot of the code. You don't have to account for every past version of a file just to compile it.

Our Living System Graph works the same way. We must distinguish between two types of operations:

**1. The "Hot Path": Real-time Generation and Lowering (Queries on the Tip)**

*   **What it is:** This is the 99% use case. The `Context Assembler` preparing a prompt, the pipeline generating tests, or an agent validating logic.
*   **How it works:** These operations are **always** performed against a single, specific graph layer (the "tip" of the current branch/version). When the system needs the definition of `function_A` or `DataType_B`, it queries a graph where there is *exactly one* definitive version of that node. The graph being queried is static and clean for the duration of the operation.
*   **Performance Implication:** **This is extremely fast.** The query complexity is relative to the size of the *current* codebase, not its entire history. A mature graph database can easily handle lookups and semantic searches on a graph representing even a massive project like the kernel, as it's a well-defined, bounded problem for a single point in time.

**2. The "Cold Path": Historical and Cross-Version Analysis**

*   **What it is:** This is the 1% use case. An architect asking, "How has our authentication module evolved over the past year?" or a debug agent trying to find when a specific logical flaw was introduced (`git bisect` on the graph).
*   **How it works:** These analytical queries are the only ones that traverse *across* different graph layers. They are explicitly designed to compare snapshots, trace a node's lineage, or analyze trends.
*   **Performance Implication:** **These queries are heavier and slower, and that's okay.** They are not part of the real-time generation pipeline. They are powerful analytical tools used for high-level decision-making, debugging, or auditing. Their performance is secondary to the speed of the primary development loop.

**The "Write" Operation: Committing a New Layer**

Creating a new version of the graph is a transactional "commit." This is where the cost of versioning is paid. However, this is not a full copy of the entire graph. Modern data structures and graph databases optimize this heavily using techniques like **structural sharing** (similar to how persistent data structures work in functional programming). When a new layer is created, it only stores the changed nodes and pointers back to the unchanged nodes in its parent layer. This makes the creation of new versions highly efficient in both time and storage space.

**In summary:** The system's performance is protected by separating the lightning-fast, real-time queries needed for code generation from the more complex, offline queries used for historical analysis. The core development loop always works with a clean, singular view of the system, ensuring speed and scalability.

### New Definition of Defects

By defining a "bug" not as an internal test failure but as a mismatch with external human expectation, we change the game entirely. The system's internal verification is not a test for "correctness" in the absolute sense, but a test for internal consistency.

Here we have categories of error, and this distinction is key:

* Pipeline Failure (Internal Inconsistency): This is when the system fails to correctly implement its own instructions. For example, the pseudocode at Level 4 says to add two numbers, but the generated code at Level 5 multiplies them. The auto-generated unit test (from Level 3) would catch this immediately. This is a self-healing problem. The system detects the inconsistency, and the Test Failure -> Re-run Pipeline loop is designed to fix it. This is not a "bug" in the traditional sense; it's a transient generation error.

* Specification-Reality Mismatch (The Real "Bug"): This is what you're talking about. The system has executed its instructions with perfect fidelity. All internal tests pass. Every layer of the graph is consistent with the layer above it. The generated code is a perfect implementation of the generated tests, which are a perfect implementation of the Acceptance Criteria. And yet, the software does the wrong thing. This happens when the specification itself was flawed, incomplete, or ambiguous.

### The Ultimate "Greenfield" Experience:
The system could become a true conversational partner. Instead of writing user stories, a product manager could have a dialogue with the system.

PM: "I want to build a photo-sharing app."

System: "Understood. Initial requirements will include user accounts, image uploads, and a feed. For user accounts, do we need social login (Google, Apple), email/password, or both? Let's start with the acceptance criteria for user registration..."
This turns the entire Level 0/1 process into a guided, Socratic dialogue that ensures clarity from the very beginning.
